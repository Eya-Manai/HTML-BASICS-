            <p> We've always known that Spider-Man's most important conflict has been within himself: the struggle between the ordinary obligations of Peter Parker and the extraordinary responsibilities of Spider-Man. But in The Amazing Spider-Man 2, Peter
                Parker finds that his greatest battle is about to begin. It's great to be Spider-Man. For Peter Parker, there's no feeling quite like swinging between skyscrapers, embracing being the hero, and spending time with Gwen. But being Spider-Man
                comes at a price: only Spider-Man can protect his fellow New Yorkers from the formidable villains that threaten the city. With the emergence of Electro, Peter must confront a foe far more powerful than he. And as his old friend, Harry
                Osborn, returns, Peter comes to realize that all of his enemies have one thing in common: Oscorp. </p>

                activity. Scott begins the series as a relatively unpopular and unathletic student who lives with his divorced mother Melissa, a nurse at Beacon Hills Memorial Hospital. As a werewolf, he develops heightened physical abilities and senses
                well beyond those of an ordinary human, but he also must control animalistic instincts that are amplified by feelings of aggression and full moons. Further complicating matters, Scott develops romantic feelings for new classmate Allison
                Argent, who comes from a family of werewolf hunters that includes her father Chris Argent. Helping Scott manage his new life are his best friend Stiles Stilinski, the son of Beacon Hills Sheriff Stilinski, and the natural-born werewolf
                Derek Hale. The supernatural events surrounding Beacon Hills also end up affecting Lydia Martin, a popular and intelligent student who discovers that she is a banshee, and Jackson Whittemore, the captain of the school's lacrosse team who
                resents Scott's newfound attention. As new and familiar threats emerge, Scott is joined by werecoyote Malia Tate, kitsune Kira Yukimura, and Scott's first beta werewolf Liam Dunbar in keeping his family, friends, and the rest of the town

                    <li> Minions </li>
                    <p>Minions are small, yellow creatures who have existed since the beginning of time, evolving from yellow single-celled organisms into beings which exist only to serve history's most evil masters, but they accidentally end up killing
                        all their masters —including a Tyrannosaurus, a caveman, a Pharaoh, and Count Dracula.— They are driven into isolation after firing a cannon at Napoleon while in Russia and start a new life inside a cave, but after many years,
                        the Minions become sad and unmotivated without a master to serve. To regain their dignity and sense of purpose, a minion named Kevin recruits two Minions called Stuart and Bob, setting out to look for a new master. In 1968, the
                        three journey to New York City, where they end up in a department store for the night, and accidentally discover a hidden commercial broadcast for villains advertising Villain-Con; a convention for all villains and supervillains
                        in Orlando. The next day they manage to hitchhike a ride with the Nelsons, a family of thieves. At the convention, they see Scarlet Overkill, an incredibly famous and popular supervillainess who unexpectedly hires them and takes
                        them to her home in London. They phone the rest of the Minions to get them to join. Scarlet plans to steal the Imperial State Crown from Queen Elizabeth II and promises to reward the Minions if they steal it, and kill them if they
                        do not. Her husband, Herb, supplies them with inventions to aid in the heist, but they are nearly caught when they break into the Tower of London. The chase leads to Bob accidentally crashing into the Sword in the Stone by pulling
                        it free to defend himself and his friends, causing Bob to remove the Queen from the throne and become King. Enraged that someone else accomplished her dream of stealing the throne, Scarlet confronts the Minions, so Bob abdicates
                        the throne in her favor. Undeterred, Scarlet imprisons the three in a dungeon before her coronation and Herb attempts to torture the trio, but they escape with the intention to apologize to Scarlet. After making their way to Westminster
                        Abbey, Stuart and Bob interrupt the coronation by inadvertently dropping a chandelier on Scarlet, who survives the falling fixture and orders their execution. Stuart and Bob are captured by other villains, while Kevin hides in
                        a pub. He sees Scarlet on television, promising that she will kill Stuart and Bob if Kevin does not show up by dawn. With the villains still searching for him, Kevin sneaks into Scarlet's castle to steal weapons, and accidentally
                        triggers a machine Herb was building and grows into a gigantic Minion. Kevin tramples through London, rescues his friends and battles Scarlet just as the other Minions turn up in London. Scarlet tries to eradicate them by firing
                        a massive missile, but Kevin swallows it. Scarlet and Herb attempt to escape with her rocket dress only for Kevin to hold onto it and get pulled into the sky. The missile finally explodes, seemingly killing Kevin, Scarlet, and
                        Herb. As the Minions mourn the loss of their leader, Kevin survives and returns to his normal size. The Queen gets her throne and crown back. She rewards Bob with a tiny crown for his teddy bear Tim, Stuart with an electric guitar,
                        and Kevin with a knighthood. The still alive Scarlet and Herb steal the crown again, but a young Gru uses a freeze ray on them and flees with the crown on a rocket-powered motorbike. The Minions run after him, deciding he is the

                    <li> Very bad trip / The hang over </li>
                    <p>Doug Billings, a cheerful but clumsy bachelor, travels to Las Vegas with his three best friends Phil Wenneck, who is a sarcastic Elementary School teacher, Stu Price, who is an easygoing dentist, and Alan Garner, who is the hyperactive
                        son of Sid, the gruff father of Doug's fiancée Tracy, in Alan's vintage Mercedes-Benz W111 to have his bachelor's party. They get a suite in Caesars Palace, and celebrate with drinks on the hotel rooftop. The next morning, Phil,
                        Stu, and Alan awaken to find they have no memory of the previous night; Doug is nowhere to be found, Stu's tooth is missing, the suite is a disaster, a tiger is in the bathroom, a chicken is in the living room, and a baby is in
                        the closet. They see Doug's mattress impaled on a statue outside of Caesars Palace and when they ask for their Mercedes, the valet delivers an LVPD police cruiser. Retracing their steps, the trio travel to a hospital where they
                        discover they were drugged with Rohypnol, causing their memory loss, and that they went to the hospital from a chapel the previous night. At the chapel, they learn that Stu married a stripper named Jade, despite being in a long-term
                        relationship with his domineering and philandering girlfriend Melissa. Outside the chapel, the trio is attacked by gangsters saying they are looking for someone. They flee and track down Jade. They are then arrested by the police
                        for having stolen the police cruiser. After being told that the Mercedes was impounded, the trio are released when they unwittingly volunteer to be targets for a taser demonstration. While driving the Mercedes, they discover a
                        naked Chinese man named Mr. Chow in the trunk, who beats the trio with a crowbar and flees. Alan confesses that he drugged their drinks to ensure they had a good night, believing the drug to be ecstasy. Returning to their suite,
                        they find Mike Tyson, who orders them to return his tiger to his mansion. Stu drugs it, they load it into the Mercedes, and drive to Tyson's mansion. However, the tiger awakens midway and attacks them, clawing Phil on the neck
                        and damaging the car's interior. They push the car the rest of the way to the mansion, and successfully deliver the tiger to Tyson. While driving back, their car is rammed by a black Cadillac Escalade manned by the gangsters from
                        the chapel and Chow, who is their boss. Chow accuses them of kidnapping him and stealing $80,000 in poker chips. As they deny it, he tells them he has Doug, and threatens to kill him if it is not returned. Unable to find Chow's
                        $80,000, Alan, with help from Stu and Jade, uses his knowledge of card counting to win $82,400 playing blackjack. The next morning, they meet Chow in the desert to exchange the chips for Doug, only to find that it is actually "Black
                        Doug", who sold the roofies to Alan the previous night. With Doug's wedding set to occur in five hours, Phil calls Tracy to tell her they cannot find Doug. Simultaneously, Black Doug mentions that someone who takes roofies is more
                        likely to end up on the floor than on the roof; Stu suddenly realizes where Doug is, interrupting Phil before he can reveal Doug's disappearance to Tracy. They travel back to Caesars Palace where they find a dazed and sunburned
                        Doug on the roof, who they moved there on his mattress the previous night as a practical joke; Doug threw the mattress onto the statue in an attempt to signal for help. Before leaving, Stu makes arrangements to go on a date with
                        Jade the following week. With no flights available to Los Angeles, the four drive home to the wedding. Despite their late arrival, Doug and Tracy are married. At the wedding, Stu breaks up with Melissa, sick of her personality.
                        Alan then finds Stu's digital camera containing photos of the events from the night in Las Vegas, and the four agree to look at the pictures before deleting them. </p>
